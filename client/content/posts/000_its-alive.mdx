### 20 days.

This is how long it took me to get to a place where I’m happy enough with this website to release it for ̶n̶o̶ ̶o̶n̶e̶ the world to see.

Hi, I’m Rèï, an architecture graduate who programs, and welcome to my website.

### Is this yet another blog? I’d like to think not.

This is a collection of entries showing how I go about designing and building stuff on the web. For the most part, I do it for my own records, but like the idea that people may come across this website and learn a thing or two. The entries are shown from newest to oldest, just so that you first see the recent stuff. 

And I think I gave the textbook definition of a blog.

### Alright so it’s a blog. Fine.

But why go through the hassle of building my own website from scratch? There are plenty other non-headache-inducing options to writing online: contribute on **[Medium](https://medium.com/creators)**, partake in forum day-to-day life, or if you really want your own platform, use **[Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)** or **[Wix](https://www.wix.com/)** to build the blog’s backbone in a day and not 20 (so 2000% faster). Also, I am now stuck with a [codebase](https://github.com/rei-dumand/personal-site) that depends on dependencies that I will have to maintain… *ad vitam aeternam*. So why the hassle?

Well…

1. I need content! Having to build this website (which you will soon learn about) has given me plenty of topics to explore and write about. The first few entries will be a reflection on some of the design and technical decisions I made to get this website where it is.
2. It’s a portfolio/blog of some sort. I built this website as a platform on which I can freely express myself, where I can document my journey as an architectural designer transitioning from a world of bricks and mortars to one made of bits and bugs. But it’s also a place where I can flex some of my creative muscles, and have full agency over how I want things to be done. I expect that over time, this website’s appearance and structure will change many times. If it does indeed embrace multiple lives, I will do my best to keep live archives of sunset versions.
3. I like to learn, and I wanted to learn how to build a website. Yeah, deep.

### Wrapping up.

No time to party! there is still plenty of work to do at the time of writing this introductory post. I still have a pile of problems to solve.

And if you stumble across this years down the line, check out **[my repository](https://github.com/rei-dumand/personal-site)** if it still exists to see whether or not I’m still working on this project.
